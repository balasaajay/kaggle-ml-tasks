# ML Models
Contains code to build, train and package a model.
Model developed and structured based on learnings from https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models/

# ML Pipelines Overview:

Data (reproducible -> R) --> Data Analysis --> Data Pre-processing(R) (Feature Engineering) --> Variable Selection(R)(Feature Selection) --> ML model building(R) --> Model deploy(R)

Data Layer(base) --> Feature layer --> Scoring layer --> Evaluation layer
